# Super-Earth-Space-Programs
Adds two playable super-earths as launch sites in a new real-scale solar system for Kerbal Space Program

Ultragaia is a planet with twice the mass of Earth, but it is not twice as wide or twice as heavy. Its atmosphere is denser than Earth's, but not by much. Ultragaia has two moons: Duarph, which is a Ceres-sized moon in a low eccentric orbit; and Circumlune, which is very similar to Earth's Moon.

Dubulrad is a planet with twice the radius of Earth, but it is 9 times the mass, and has 5 times the atmosphere. It is an altogether different challenge to launch from. Dubulrad has four moons which are roughly analagous to the Jovian moons, though around half the size--subject to change. They are Oye, Euor, Galan, and Calid. Galan is currently just a Tylo Clone.

In addition to those two homeworlds and their moons, there is also the planet Derjulan, a tiny sub-neptune with only 2 Earth masses, with an additional Earth mass in the form of its moon Aquarii, which is nearly identical to Earth.

All of this is in orbit around the K-dwarf Caldos.
